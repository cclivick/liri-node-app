# SIRI-style Node Application

This is a node command-line application that can achieve the following functions:

## concert-this

Users can look up concerts for artists of their choice. Typing "node liri concert-this [artist]" into the command line will provide a list of all available concert data (specifically the data of each concert, its location, and the name of the venue). This feature uses the Bands in Town API.
